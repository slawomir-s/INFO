Hello !

I divided my repository on account of technologies used in projects and transparency.

The first section contains websites, encrypted by myself based on the PSD convention. Used: HTML, CSS / SASS, Bootstrap, RWD, Grunt, Git.

The second section contains a few JS training projects.

The third department is regarding sheer JS plans / jQuery. Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RWD, clean JS, jQuery, Ajax, API, Grunt, Git.

In the subject of every project a link to the version was added live. If you are interested I am encouraging you to watch projects and the evaluation ðŸ™‚

Please feel free to call me on 667 100 594 or contact by email: slaweks48@gmail.com, if you require any further information.
